# Stage 1: Build - Use Node.js to build static files
FROM node:18-alpine as build

# Set working directory inside the container
WORKDIR /app

# Copy package.json and package-lock.json for dependency installation
COPY package*.json ./

# Install project dependencies
RUN npm install

# Copy all source files to the container
COPY . .

# Build the application for production
RUN npm run build

# Stage 2: Serve - Use lightweight Nginx to serve the built files
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy built files from Stage 1 to Nginx's default serving directory
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# Copy custom Nginx configuration to override the default config
COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/conf.d/default.conf

# Expose port 80 for HTTP traffic
EXPOSE 80

# Start Nginx in the foreground (required for Docker containers)
CMD ["nginx", "-g", "daemon off;"]
